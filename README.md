1. Purpose
I'm going to create a inspired version of Jennifer Dewalt's 180 day challenge window website (https://jenniferdewalt.com/window/page). I'll be using anime/manga visuals (it could change)


2. Estimated time schedule (1 week preparation)
Monday
  rest of the day:
  getting the index.html started
  trying to set up am opaque 'window'
  create a file w random images
  create a file w different sounds? (have to find out how to implement that later on?? but this part is optional...)

Tuesday
  morning: continue from Monday's work (html stuff)
  noon: pseudo code one function at a time >> randomize image function
  night: pseudo code and implementing continued

Wednesday
  morning: continue from Tuesday's work (writing randomize image functions)
  rest of the day: figure out how to create a virtual opaque window slider/panel using html, css, and jquery??

Thursday
  morning: continue from Wednesday's work ()

Friday
  rest of the day: css styling


3. Functions needed to complete this goal
  random number func
  retrieve an image url from our image array func (w random number func)

  jquery event handle
    new image every time refresh
    new image every time button is clicked
    when window is lifted: increase the volume (how??? check l8r)
    when window is lowered: decrease the volume
    button highlight event handle


4. Things i must keep in back of my mind
how to add soundtrack to my webpage
how to automatically play sound
how to increase/lower volume
how make window user mover friendly


5. Extra possible ideas to self (not necessary)
Generate new sounds
Image could be video playback
